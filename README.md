Use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize data.

Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value.

->COUNT() : counts rows


->SUM() : adds values


->AVG() : returns average


->MIN() : smallest value


->MAX() : largest value



GROUP BY is used to categorize results 

HAVING is used to filter groups "after aggregation".
